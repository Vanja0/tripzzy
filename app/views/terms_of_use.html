Tripzzy does not endorse or assume any responsibility for any such third-party sites, information, materials, products, or services. If you access a third party website from the Service, you do so at your own risk, and you understand that this Agreement and Tripzzy's Privacy Policy do not apply to your use of such sites.</p>

                <p>Registration to Tripzzy.com is performed only trough User's Facebook account. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use "strong" passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. Tripzzy will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.<br>
                    You are responsible for all usage of your User account and/or User name, whether authorized or not authorized by User. You agree to immediately notify Tripzzy of any unauthorized use of your user account, user name or password.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Email usage</h4>
                    
                    <p>By providing Tripzzy your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special offers.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h4>Tripzzy Service Restrains</h4>
                    
                    <p>You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) copying, distributing, or disclosing any part of the Service in any medium, including without limitation by any automated or non-automated "scraping"; (ii) using any automated system, including without limitation "robots," "spiders," "offline readers," etc., to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Tripzzy servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser (except that Tripzzy grants the operators of public search engines revocable permission to use spiders to copy materials from Tripzzy.com for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials); (iii) transmitting spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email; (iv) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service; (v) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vi) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Service; (vii) collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service; (viii) using the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes, unless expressly permitted in writing by Tripzzy; (ix) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (x) interfering with the proper working of the Service; (xi) accessing any content on the Service through any technology or means other than those provided or authorized by the Service; or (xii) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content therein.
                        Accessing the audiovisual content that may be available on the Service for any purpose or in any manner other than Streaming (as defined below) is expressly prohibited. "Streaming" means a contemporaneous digital transmission of an audiovisual work via the Internet from the Tripzzy Service to a User's device in such a manner that the data is intended for real-time viewing and not intended to be copied, stored, permanently downloaded, or redistributed by the User.
                        We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to users generally; or create usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.
                        You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Tripzzy Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users. Tripzzy shall have no liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any User's action or inaction.</p>
                        <h4>User Content</h4>
                        
                        <p>You agree that all information or data of any kind, whether text, software, code, music or sound, photographs or graphics, video or other materials (" User content"), made available publicly or privately, will be under the sole responsibility of the person providing the said content, or of the person whose user account is used. You agree that this website may expose you to content that may be objectionable or offensive. Tripzzy will not be responsible to you in any way for content displayed on this web site, nor for any error or omission. By using this website or any service provided, you explicitly agree that: (a) you will not provide any User content or conduct yourself in any way that may be construed as: unlawful; illegal; threatening; harmful; abusive; harassing; stalking; tortuous; defamatory; libelous; vulgar; obscene; offensive; objectionable; pornographic; designed to interfere with or disrupt the operation of this website or any service provided; infected with a virus or other destructive or deleterious programming routine; giving rise to civil or criminal liability; or in violation of an applicable local, national or international law; (b) you will not impersonate or misrepresent your association with any person or entity; you will not forge or otherwise seek to conceal or misrepresent the origin of any content provided by you; (c) you will not collect or harvest any information about other users; (d) you will not provide, and you will not use this website to provide, any content or service in any commercial manner, or in any manner that would involve junk mail, spam, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or any other form of unauthorized advertising or commerce; you will not use this website to promote or operate any service or content without the site editor's prior written consent; (e) you will not provide any content that may give rise to Tripzzy being held civilly or criminally liable, or that may be considered a violation of any local, national, or international law, including -- but not limited to -- laws relating to copyrights, trademarks, patents, or trade secrets.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Friends' tripzzies</h4>
                        
                        <p>User can only see content created by his/hers Facebook friends. This keeps Tripzzy a closed network ensuring high quality content.</p>
                        
                        <h4>User Content License Grant</h4>
                        
                        <p>By posting any User Content on the Service, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, to Tripzzy a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, edit, translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User Content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, for use in connection with the Service and Tripzzy's (and its successors' and affiliates') business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each User of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your User Content through the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such User Content as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under this Agreement.<br>
                            If the features of the Service allow you to remove or delete User Content from the Service, the above licenses granted by you in your User Content terminate within a commercially reasonable time after you remove or delete such User Content from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that Tripzzy may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of User Content that have been removed or deleted. The above licenses granted by you in User Content for which the Service does not provide you a means to delete or remove are perpetual and irrevocable.<br>
                            Tripzzy reserves the right, but is not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content that Tripzzy believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions under this Agreement</p>
                            
                            <h4>Tripzzy content liability</h4>
                            
                            <p>You expressly understand and agree that Tripzzy will not be liable for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential or exemplary damages; this includes, but is not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if Tripzzy has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from (i) the use of services or the inability to use services, (ii) the cost of obtaining substitute goods and/or services resulting from any transaction entered into or through services, (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your data transmissions, (iv) statements by any third party or conduct of any third party using services, or (v) any other matter relating to services. In some jurisdictions, it is not permitted to limit liability and, therefore, such limitations may not apply to you. All other terms and conditions remain enforceable notwithstanding.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Tripzzy and Travel Services</h4>
                            
                            <p>Tripzzy makes no representation or warranty with respect to the ability of any travel provider in its Travel Provider Network or otherwise (a "provider") to deliver any services or products. Tripzzy cannot ensure that a provider will actually complete a transaction or deliver any of the services or products that it agrees to deliver. Tripzzy does not transfer legal ownership of tickets, reservations, vouchers, coupons or other products or services from Provider to User, and nothing in the Agreement shall modify applicable law governing sale of goods, or services, including travel services.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Mobile Software</h4>
                            
                            <p>We may make available software to access the Service via a mobile device ("Mobile Software"). To use the Mobile Software you must have a mobile device that is compatible with the Mobile Service. Tripzzy does not warrant that the Mobile Software will be compatible with your mobile device. Tripzzy hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code copy of the Mobile Software for one Tripzzy account on one mobile device owned or leased solely by you, for your personal use. You may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Mobile Software, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Mobile Software to any third party or use the Mobile Software to provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii) make any copies of the Mobile Software; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Mobile Software, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content accessible through the Mobile Software, or features that enforce limitations on use of the Mobile Software; or (v) delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the Mobile Software. You acknowledge that Tripzzy may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the Mobile Software, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version of the Mobile Software that you are using on your mobile device. You consent to such automatic upgrading on your mobile device, and agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to all such upgrades. Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the Mobile Software is covered by the applicable open source or third-party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Mobile Software or any copy thereof, and Tripzzy or its third party partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the Mobile Software (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of the rights, duties or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, is void. Tripzzy reserves all rights not expressly granted under this Agreement.</p>

Use of the Tripzzy Content for any purpose not expressly permitted by this Agreement is strictly prohibited.<br>
                                You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments or ideas about the Service, including without limitation about how to improve the Service or our products ("Feedback"). By submitting any Feedback, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place Tripzzy under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that we are free to use the Feedback without any additional compensation to you, and/or to disclose the Feedback on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone.
